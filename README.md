# Gamedream - A portfolio project.

This is my milestone 3 project. For this, I have decided to create a game wishlisting service to allow for storing games and then wishlisting them; complete with their prices, name and description.

# Deployment #

To deploy my site I used heroku. This was done by using the following steps.

1. Generating a requirements.txt file containing the python dependencies needed for the project.
2. Create a Procfile to contain the command for starting up the website.
3. Create a new variable in __init__.py called DATABASE_URL to allow the project to read an external database.
4. Log on to Heroku.com and create a new app, while also giving it a unique name and setting the region to europe.
5. In the settings section, create a config var on the heroku app and assign it the url given by Code Institute.
6. Add to the config var all the details contained in env.py except DEVELOPMENT and DB_URL.
7. Go onto the deploy section, and use Connect to Github as the deployment method.
8. Select your github repo from the list and use Manual Deploy to deploy the branch of choice.
9. Use the run command feature and type python3 into the console to get the python interpreter.
10. Run Terminal.py to build the database for the site.
11. Click run app and enjoy! Be sure to ensure that the site works as it should and that DEBUG is set to false.

# Languages #

* For the development of this website I utilized HTML, CSS, JS and Python in order to create it. 

* Bootstrap 5.3.3 was used to create the accordion and for it's grid system in laying out site features.

# Media Queries #

# Software #

VS Code was used to create the website. It was the tool for typing out HTML, CSS, JS and Python code along with pushing site updates to the Github repository. Gitpod was used to provide backend and virtual environment support for the use of python without which the site would not function.

Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes saw earlier in this readme.

The microsoft snipping tool was used to take the relevant screenshots.
